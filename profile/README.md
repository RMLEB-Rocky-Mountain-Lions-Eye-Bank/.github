## Our Mission

The mission of the Rocky Mountain Lions Eye Bank (RMLEB) is to fulfill the wishes of eye donors and their families to help others overcome blindness through transplantation and research.

Serving Colorado and Wyoming, RMLEB is a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring sight. We work with donors, families, medical professionals, and researchers to provide the precious gift of corneal tissue to those in need.

## What We Do

RMLEB facilitates the entire eye donation process with compassion and professionalism. Our key services include:

* **Eye Tissue Recovery & Transplantation:** We coordinate the recovery of donated eye tissue and ensure its safe and timely distribution for sight-restorative cornea transplants, both locally and around the world.
* **Research & Education:** We provide eye tissue that is not suitable for transplant to researchers working to cure eye diseases and prevent blindness.
* **Public & Professional Education:** We offer education to hospital staff, coroners, funeral home partners, and the general public about the vital importance of eye, organ, and tissue donation.
* **Donor Registry Support:** We provide funding and support for the Donate Life Colorado and Donate Life Wyoming donor registries.
* **Eye Surgery Grant:** We offer grants to residents of Colorado and Wyoming who lack the financial resources for medically necessary eye surgery.
* **International Surgery Fund:** This fund helps defray costs associated with placing tissue internationally, ensuring that every viable cornea can be used to give sight, and supports humanitarian surgical missions.

## Our Impact

Since 1982, the Rocky Mountain Lions Eye Bank has helped carry out the wishes of thousands of eye donors, facilitating tens of thousands of sight-restorative transplants locally, throughout the United States, and around the world.

## How You Can Help

There are many ways to support our mission to end preventable blindness:

### 1. Register as a Donor

The most important way to help is to register your decision to be an eye, organ, and tissue donor. It's a gift that costs nothing but gives back immeasurably.
